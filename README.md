# Pet2Cage-
A Simple addon to automatically cage duplicated battle pets

## What is this for?

We all might know the issue to have 2 or even 3 individuals of a certain battle pet species and lost overview about our collected ones. Or we level 'em and are looking for an easy way to cage all those duplicated pets to sell 'em in the auction house.

That's where my WeakAura "CageDuplicatePetsButton" comes around and this addon is intended to be a rework and a fix for the obvious down sides of that WeakAura

- **time limit to do what the aura should do** - _This is because Blizzard actively limits WeakAuras execution times. Everything a WeakAura does have to be done within a single frame. This limitation led to the problem, that the button could only cage 5 duplicated pets at once and therefore required several clicks to cage all pets._
- **no configurability for pets to be ignored or even caged entirely** - _Maybe this one would have been doable but back in that time I didn't feel ready for this as Lua was extremely new to me._

Those down sides are what this addon is intended to address while still providing the known behavior of the mentioned WeakAura.
